## Access Tokens
Go into your canvas settings, and generate a new access token with no expiration. Make sure to save it.

Enter your access token(s) in settings.json like this:
```
{
    "access_tokens": [
        "accessToken1",
        "accessToken2"
    ]
}
```
* Note that it will work with however many access tokens you give it.
